## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to get by on my own, without any video tutorial to help me, this was the first site without a tutorial I've done, it's simple but I'm very proud of it!

### Continued development

I want to develop my ability to make decisions to start the project, it took me a long time to understand what was to be done, I thought I had to do the QR Code when it was already done in the /images folder hahah.
I want to improve my CSS!

### Useful resources

- [Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I always use this guide to use flexbox, I still haven't decorated everything and it helped me to position and center the QR code, it also helped me in the responsiveness of the site!
- [Music Bro!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QY2_8704o) - This playlist gave me great focus while working on the project.
